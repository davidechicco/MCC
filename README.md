# The advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) in binary classification evaluation
Script thar generates R plots for the comparison between Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), accuracy, and F1 score.

To use this script, you need to have **R (â‰¥ 3.3.0)** installed on your computer, together with the following R packages:
* **grid**
* **gridExtra**
* **ggplot2**
* **cowplot**

To run the main script, you have to clone or download this repository, and then run the following commands:

`cd bin`

`Rscript script_pies_and_barplots.r`

The program will generate the output pdf files of the plot images in the `plots` folder.
